   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ``pansat``'s documentation!
======================================


``pansat`` aims to provide a unified interface to download, manage, and access a
wide range of satellite, reanalysis and other meteorological data. The project
was born out of the observation that scientists spend too much time figuring out
how to download and access data from the wide array of products available to
them. While it is not clear whether ``pansat`` can stand up to this challenge it
aims to at least encourage the development of reusable code to access certain
datasets.
