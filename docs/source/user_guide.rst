Introduction
============

Pansat is a python package that provides an easy interface to download data relevant to atmospheric research.
So far, several satellite and reanalysis products are implemented as well as radiosonde measurements. See 
:ref:`products` for all available products. The aim is to add more functionality to the package in the future,
for example collocation between different products.

The package requires at least python version 3.8 and is being tested on Unix-based operating systems. For Windows,
the test-coverage is not equally large, so pansat may only work in parts.

Installation

before downloading data for the first time. See the specific :ref:`providers` classes for
links to the websites.
