pansat.download.providers
=========================

The ``providers`` module provides classes to access online services that allow
downloading data. Objects of these data provider classes provide download access
for specific data products. For this,  an object of the data provider class
must be instantiated with a given product object. If the product is available
from the data provider class, the resulting data provider instance can be used
to download files of the data product.
